DitherTron
==========

This online tool converts full-color images to 8-bit retro formats,
performing cropping, downsampling, and dithering.

For some formats (e.g. C64 multicolor) it also searches for good palette colors for individual subblocks.

TODO: Allow download of data files for target system, import into 8bitworkshop.
